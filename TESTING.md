## Testing overview & environment

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire development. I used the CI Python Linter tool and GITPOD terminal output whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along. The validation process adhered to the guidelines outlined in PEP8. The majority of warnings stemmed from redundant or missing whitespace, as well as instances of redundant backslashes and insufficient indentation. These issues have been addressed and rectified accordingly.

### Test environment

* Desktop:
  * Lenovo Legion T7
* Screen:
  * Samsung Odyssey G3 / 27" / 1920 x 1080 /

### Browser compatibility

* Google Chrome, version 121.0.6167.86 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Firefox, version 123.0 (64-bit)

### Responsiveness

Although not directly applicable to this project, I gained valuable knowledge on adjusting the mock terminal window size. This exploration allowed me to enhance the user interface with a more friendly table display. However, to maintain consistency with Code Institute's settings and requirements, I ultimately reverted these adjustments. Instead, I tailored my code to conform to the given limits of the mock terminal environment. This experience underscored the importance of adaptability and optimization within predefined constraints, enriching my understanding of creating user-centric interfaces within specific technical boundaries.

## Automated Testing

No automatic testing apart from using the pep8 validator was performed.

### PEP8 validator 

* [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python code. The result is ALL CLEAR, NO ERRORS FOUND.

#### Comment<sup>1</sup>

I lack the technical skills necessary to manually trigger rate limits by conducting numerous operations that generate API requests in a short span or to emulate conditions of network disruptions or API unavailability. These test cases serve as a reminder that it's crucial to assess such scenarios, especially if there are plans to expand the application further.

## DEFECTS

### Bug-01

I tested the scenario of attempting to open a non-existent worksheet by renaming the tab in my Google Sheets document to 'taskdbx', rendering the database inaccessible. This resulted in a ```gspread.exceptions.WorksheetNotFound``` error.

#### Solution-Bug-01
To address this issue, I implemented a try-except block to handle potential failures. The code attempts to open the worksheet named 'taskdb'. If the worksheet is not found, it catches the 'WorksheetNotFound' exception, prints an error message, and exits the program.

```python
# Google Sheets setup
CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file("creds.json")
SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open("task-master-database")
# Attempt to open the worksheet
try:
    worksheet = SHEET.worksheet("taskdb")
    # If the worksheet is found, continue with the program
except gspread.WorksheetNotFound:
    # If the worksheet is not found, print an error message and exit
    print("Error: Worksheet not found")
    exit()
```

### Bug-02

As mentioned in the [chapter Responsiveness](#responsiveness) I returned to the original size of the mock terminal. This necessitated altering the presentation format of information within the table upon rendering. During testing to ensure these modifications worked as planned, I discovered that the To-Do column had to be limited to 30 characters to prevent strings and integers from exceeding the column boundaries, which would otherwise completely disrupt the table's structure. 

![x](/documentation/images/table-no_wrap.webp)

### Solution Bug-02

The problem was solved by introducing a new function, ```def wrap_text(text, width):```, and updating the ```def list_all_tasks():``` function. These modifications implement text wrapping, which automatically divides longer text lines at a specified maximum character limit. This ensures that text remains within a readable width, enhancing the presentation and readability of the information displayed.

![x](/documentation/images/table-wrap.webp)

### Bug-03

In 'Menu To-Do-List' I select '2. List All tasks' and then hit enter to select 'sort by Task ID'. which results in the fault message:

![x](/documentation/images/wrap_text-fail.webp)

It seemed the problem arose when attempting to wrap text that is not a string, specifically when task["To-Do"] is an integer or contains integer values that are not automatically converted to string types by the wrap_text function or the textwrap.wrap method within it. I assumed this likely happens if a task's "To-Do" field is purely numeric and not explicitly cast to a string before being passed to wrap_text.

### Solution Bug-03
Edit: In a later version, lib textwrap was removed and a function was refactored with custom code, which still converts to string.

I assumed that the most direct way to solve this issue was to ensure that any value passed to wrap_text was explicitly converted to a string, regardless of its original type. I modified the wrap_text function to automatically convert its input to a string, ensuring compatibility with all types of input.

```python
def wrap_text(text, width):
    """
    Amended from: docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html
    Wraps text to the specified width and returns a list of wrapped lines.
    Ensures that the text is treated as a string to avoid errors with non-string inputs.
    """
    # Ensure the input is treated as a string to prevent errors
    text = str(text)
    return textwrap.wrap(text, width, break_long_words=True)
```

### Bug-04

During the task update process, I encountered an issue when prompted to enter a new date or choose to skip this step. Specifically, if an incorrect date was inputâ€”either due to being in the wrong format or not being set in the futureâ€”the application would incorrectly proceed to the next prompt, which asks to enter a new status. This behaviour bypassed the opportunity for the user to correct the date input, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate task updates.

![x](/documentation/images/bug04.webp)

### Solution Bug-04

To address this issue, I've refactored the code to ensure that users are now looped back to the "Enter a new status" prompt if they input an incorrect date. This revision introduces built-in loops for immediate error correction and provides users with the option to skip updating if they choose. The original implementation aimed to abstract the input gathering process to improve code organization. While this approach was intended to create a more structured codebase, it inadvertently made user retries more complicated. The latest code adjustments aim to strike a better balance between code organization and user interaction fluidity.

![x](/documentation/images/bug04-s.webp)

### Bug-05

 PrettyTable output overflow, when entering a long string of empty characters.
 
 ### Solution Bug-05

 Code has been modified to strip leading and trailing spaces from the input text before wrapping. It checks if the stripped text is empty and returns an empty list if so, ensuring that long empty strings are handled more gracefully. 

### Bug-06

In the "update task" functionality, when adding a new due date, the system accepts the input in the YY-M-D format, which is inconsistent with the desired YY-MM-DD format.

### Solution Bug-06

Implement validation by splitting the input string by - to separate year, month, and day components. Then, check if each component meets the expected length: two digits for the year, two digits for the month, and two digits for the day. If the input does not conform to these expectations, introduce a new error message to inform the user. This ensures the due date is strictly in the YY-MM-DD format, enhancing data consistency and preventing format-related errors. This solution  standardizes date input across the application, promoting uniformity and reducing potential confusion for users.

### Bug-07

When attempting to delete tasks I encountered a peculiar issue. Initially, I entered 4 task IDs without commas, which was correctly identified as an error by the system. However, when I attempted to delete these tasks by entering the IDs with commas but incorrectly specifying the task IDs, the system still deleted the four most recent tasks. This behavior suggests that the system might not be correctly identifying and processing the task IDs entered by the user, leading to unintended deletion of tasks.

### Solution Bug-07

The revised code adds a step to verify that each task ID entered by the user exists before proceeding with the deletion. This ensures that the function does not attempt to delete tasks that do not exist, which could lead to confusion or errors.

### UNSOLVED issue 

* In the current version of the app, entering 'back' during task update redirects users to the main menu rather than the previous step, which isn't ideal for user experience. This issue will be addressed and corrected in future updates.

* When users quickly enter selections in the Task Master application, an issue arises where input can overlap with existing text on the console. This problem seems to stem from the way the application handles asynchronous input and output operations, leading to a situation where the console output does not synchronize correctly with user inputs. As a result, the user experience is negatively impacted, with the terminal display becoming cluttered and confusing. This issue will be addressed and corrected in future updates. 

![x](/documentation/images/overlap.webp)

* Currently, the Task Master application operates without user-specific login functionality, limiting its ability to support multiple users simultaneously. This presents a challenge for environments where task management needs to be personalized or shared among team members. 

* If the application frequently interacts with Google Sheets, reaching API rate limits could lead to temporary disruptions. 

* The application currently does not implement user-specific authentication for accessing the Google Sheets backend.

* As of the current version, the Task Master application has not been comprehensively evaluated for accessibility features, including screen reader compatibility, colour contrast, and keyboard navigation, which are crucial for users with disabilities. I recognize the importance of making the application accessible to all users and am committed to improving these aspects in future updates.

* In developing the app, I employed Pylint (v2023.10.1) which flagged the use of a broad try-except block with "Catching too general exception Exception." Despite the general advice against catching broad exceptions, I opted for this method for several reasons, fully aware of the best practices. This decision balances robustness and user-friendliness, ensuring that users are shielded from raw Python errors with more accessible error messages. It's particularly vital for managing unforeseen errors from external dependencies like Google Sheets API, where issues like API limits can arise. Recognizing the challenge of covering all potential errors from various sources, this approach serves as a safeguard against unhandled crashes, enhancing user experience. I'm committed to evolving this strategy as the application and its error handling capabilities develop.
