Testing was ongoing throughout the entire development. I utilised CI Python Linter tool and GITPOD terminal output whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along. The validation process adhered to the guidelines outlined in PEP8. The majority of warnings stemmed from redundant or missing whitespace, as well as instances of redundant backslashes and insufficient indentation. These issues have been addressed and rectified accordingly.

## Automated Testing

No automatic testing apart from using the pep8 validator was perfomed.

### PEP8 validator 

* [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python code. Result is ALL CLEAR, NO ERRORS FOUND.

#### Error Handling (ERR)

| TestCase ID | Feature | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Result | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ERR-01 | Invalid Task ID | For invalid Task ID inputs, the application prevents action and displays an error message. ID.  | Attempt actions with non-existent Task ID. | PASS | |
| ERR-02 | Update Non-existent Task | Attempting to update a task that does not exist shows an error message indicating the task cannot be found. | Update a task with an ID that doesn't exist. | PASS | |

| ITC-03 | Handling API Rate Limits | The application gracefully handles rate limit errors by queueing requests or notifying the user. | Simulate conditions where the API's rate limits are exceeded.  | Not exec |  See comment<sup>1</sup>|
| ITC-04 | Recovery from API Disruptions | The application provides informative feedback to the user and attempts reconnection or data sync when possible. | Simulate an API disruption or outage and observe application response. | Not Exec | See comment<sup>1</sup> | 

#### Comment<sup>1</sup>

I lack the technical skills necessary to manually trigger rate limits by conducting numerous operations that generate API requests in a short span, or to emulate conditions of network disruptions or API unavailability. These test cases serve as a reminder that it's crucial to assess such scenarios, especially if there are plans to expand the application further.

## DEFECTS

### Bug-01

I tested the scenario of attempting to open a non-existent worksheet by renaming the tab in my Google Sheets document to 'taskdbx', rendering the database inaccessible. This resulted in a ```gspread.exceptions.WorksheetNotFound``` error.

#### Solution-Bug-01
To address this issue, I implemented a try-except block to handle potential failures. The code attempts to open the worksheet named 'taskdb'. If the worksheet is not found, it catches the 'WorksheetNotFound' exception, prints an error message, and exits the program.

```python
# Google Sheets setup
CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file("creds.json")
SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open("task-master-database")
# Attempt to open the worksheet
try:
    worksheet = SHEET.worksheet("taskdb")
    # If the worksheet is found, continue with the program
except gspread.WorksheetNotFound:
    # If the worksheet is not found, print an error message and exit
    print("Error: Worksheet not found")
    exit()
