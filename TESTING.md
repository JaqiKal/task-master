## Testing overview & environment

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire development. I utilised CI Python Linter tool and GITPOD terminal output whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along. The validation process adhered to the guidelines outlined in PEP8. The majority of warnings stemmed from redundant or missing whitespace, as well as instances of redundant backslashes and insufficient indentation. These issues have been addressed and rectified accordingly.

### Test environment

* Desktop:
  * Lenovo Legion T7
* Screen:
  * Samsung Odyssey G3 / 27" / 1920 x 1080 /
* Google Chrome, version 121.0.6167.86 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### Responsiveness

Although not directly applicable to this project, I gained valuable knowledge on adjusting the mock terminal window size. This exploration allowed me to enhance the user interface with a more friendly table display. However, to maintain consistency with Code Institute's settings and requirements, I ultimately reverted these adjustments. Instead, I tailored my code to conform to the given limits of the mock terminal environment. This experience underscored the importance of adaptability and optimization within predefined constraints, enriching my understanding of creating user-centric interfaces within specific technical boundaries.

## Automated Testing

No automatic testing apart from using the pep8 validator was perfomed.

### PEP8 validator 

* [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the python code. Result is ALL CLEAR, NO ERRORS FOUND.

#### Comment<sup>1</sup>

I lack the technical skills necessary to manually trigger rate limits by conducting numerous operations that generate API requests in a short span, or to emulate conditions of network disruptions or API unavailability. These test cases serve as a reminder that it's crucial to assess such scenarios, especially if there are plans to expand the application further.

## DEFECTS

### Bug-01

I tested the scenario of attempting to open a non-existent worksheet by renaming the tab in my Google Sheets document to 'taskdbx', rendering the database inaccessible. This resulted in a ```gspread.exceptions.WorksheetNotFound``` error.

#### Solution-Bug-01
To address this issue, I implemented a try-except block to handle potential failures. The code attempts to open the worksheet named 'taskdb'. If the worksheet is not found, it catches the 'WorksheetNotFound' exception, prints an error message, and exits the program.

```python
# Google Sheets setup
CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file("creds.json")
SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open("task-master-database")
# Attempt to open the worksheet
try:
    worksheet = SHEET.worksheet("taskdb")
    # If the worksheet is found, continue with the program
except gspread.WorksheetNotFound:
    # If the worksheet is not found, print an error message and exit
    print("Error: Worksheet not found")
    exit()
```

### Bug-02

As mentioned in the [chapter Responsiveness](#responsiveness) I returned to the original size of the mock terminal. This necessitated altering the presentation format of information within the table upon rendering. During testing to ensure these modifications worked as planned, I discovered that the To-Do column had to be limited to 30 characters to prevent strings and integers from exceeding the column boundaries, which would otherwise completely disrupt the table's structure. 

![x](/documentation/images/table-no_wrap.webp)

### Solution Bug-02

The problem was solved by introducing a new function, ```def wrap_text(text, width):```, and updating the ```def list_all_tasks():``` function. These modifications implement text wrapping, which automatically divides longer text lines at a specified maximum character limit. This ensures that text remains within a readable width, enhancing the presentation and readability of the information displayed.

![x](/documentation/images/table-wrap.webp)

### Bug-03

In 'Menu To-Do-List' I select '2. List All tasks' and then hit enter to select 'sort by Task ID'. which results in fault message:

![x](/documentation/images/wrap_text-fail.webp)

It seemed the problem arised when attempting to wrap text that is not a string, specifically when task["To-Do"] is an integer or contains integer values that are not automatically converted to string types by the wrap_text function or the textwrap.wrap method within it. I assumed this likely happens if a task's "To-Do" field is purely numeric and not explicitly cast to a string before being passed to wrap_text.

### Solution Bug-03

I assumed that the most direct way to solve this issue was to ensure that any value passed to wrap_text was explicitly converted to a string, regardless of its original type. I modified the wrap_text function to automatically convert its input to a string, ensuring compatibility with all types of input.

```python
def wrap_text(text, width):
    """
    Amended from: docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html
    Wraps text to the specified width and returns a list of wrapped lines.
    Ensures that the text is treated as a string to avoid errors with non-string inputs.
    """
    # Ensure the input is treated as a string to prevent errors
    text = str(text)
    return textwrap.wrap(text, width, break_long_words=True)
```
